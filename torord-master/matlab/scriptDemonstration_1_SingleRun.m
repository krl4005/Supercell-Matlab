% This is a simple script which runs the control endocardial model for 100
% beats and plots membrane potential and calcium transient.

%% Setting parameters
clear 

% Param is the structure of model parameters that the user may wish to
% change compared to default simulation. The full list is given in the
% function ORdRunner, and it mainly includes cell type, current
% multipliers, extracellular ionic concentrations, or fraction of NCX and ICaL
% localisation in junctional subspace.
param.bcl = 1000; % basic cycle length in ms
param.model = @model_Torord; % which model is to be used - right now, use @model_Torord. In general, any model with the same format of inputs/outputs as @model_Torord may be simulated, which is useful when current formulations are changed within the model code, etc.
param.verbose = true; % printing numbers of beats simulated.

options = []; % parameters for ode15s - usually empty
beats = 100; % number of beats
ignoreFirst = beats - 1; % this many beats at the start of the simulations are ignored when extracting the structure of simulation outputs (i.e., beats - 1 keeps the last beat).

X0 = getStartingState('Torord_endo'); % starting state - can be also Torord_mid or Torord_epi for midmyocardial or epicardial cells respectively.

%% Simulation and extraction of outputs

% The structure param and other variables are passed to modelRunner, which is
% an interface between user and the simulation code itself (which is in
% model_Torord.m). The modelRunner unpacks the structure of parameters given by
% the users, sets undefined parameters to default, and sends all that to
% @model_Torord.

% time, X are cell arrays corresponding to stored beats (if 1 beat is
% simulated, this is 1-by-1 cell still), giving time vectors and state
% variable values at corresponding time points.
[time, X] = modelRunner(X0, options, param, beats, ignoreFirst);

% A structure of currents is computed from the state variables (see the
% function code for a list of properties extracted - also, hitting Tab
% following typing 'currents.' lists all the fields of the structure). Some
% state variables are also stored in a named way (time, V, Cai, Cass) so
% that the user can do most of necessary plotting simply via accessing the
% structure currents as shown below. 
currents = getCurrentsStructure(time, X, param, 0);
