%% This gives an example of a multicriterial genetic algorithm which refits the ToR-ORd model to aim for 
% APD 400 (greater than in control) and CaT amplitude of 2e-4 (200 nM),
% which is smaller than in control. This is of course just an artificial
% example with no particular meaning. If you're unfamiliar with this method
% in the context of cardiac models, feel free to have a look at our blog at
% TODO link when published.
%
% The parameters that are evolved are conductances of: ICaL, IKs, IKr,
% INaL, and Jup multiplier (SERCA reuptake). I.e., we have 5 input
% parameters, and a 2-element fitness.

% Parameters for the optimizer:
nGenerations = 5; % number of optimization generations (cycles of crossover, mutation, and selection)
timeLimit = 60 * 60; % rough time limit of the optimization in seconds. However, the generation that happens when the limit is reached is finished.
popSize = 10; % Number of creatures in the population.

% The runtime of the optimization is roughly proportional to X * popSize * nGenerations,
% where X is the runtime of a single fitness (worth measuring this using
% tic-toc). The runtime is then cut down by the number of cores used. The
% scaling of this is good and performance gain is substantial, as long as
% the fitness computation takes a nontrivial amount of time (>1s), which it
% does almost always with cardiac models.

% Here are options set - in addition to the ones above, 'PlotFcn' selects
% type of progress visualisation (plotting Pareto front in this case), and
% 'UseParallel' says that all available cores are to be used. If you run
% parpool(X) before this line, it specifies how many cores are
% to be used (e.g. less than maximum if the computer is to be used for
% other work).
options = optimoptions(@gamultiobj,'PlotFcn',@gaplotpareto, 'UseParallel',false, 'Generations', nGenerations, 'TimeLimit', timeLimit, 'PopulationSize', popSize);

% We can restrict the multipliers of curents. Here, we restrict them to 50%-200% of the current. As we're using
% log-multipliers (see Appendix/SupMat 2 for rationale), these correspond
% to log(0.5) ~ -0.7 and log(2) ~ 0.7.
lowerBound = -0.7 * ones(5,1);  
upperBound = 0.7 * ones(5,1);  

% The multicriterial GA is started (this takes a while even for the small
% population and short fitness runtime. It also does not really converge -
% more creatures and generations would be needed.

% @fitnessTesting is a handle to the fitness function.
[coeffEstimate,FVAL,EXITFLAG,OUTPUT,POPULATION,SCORE] = gamultiobj(@fitnessTesting, 5,[],[],[],[], lowerBound, upperBound, options);

%% COMMENT: When large population is computed with long generations, it's often worth storing each generation (in case of power outage, or researcher wanting
% to look at non-final generations, to see how the algorithm converges). To do this, outputFcn (set in gaoptimset) can be defined to store population 
% at the end of each generation.
%
% That may look e.g. like:
%
% function [state,options,optchanged] = saveGeneration(options,state,flag)
% generation = state.Generation;
% population = state.Population;
% score = state.Score;
% optchanged = false;
% save(['intermediateGAstates/' num2str(generation)], 'population','score');
% end
%
% % Note that the folder intermediateGAstates must exist first.
